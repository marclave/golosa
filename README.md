# Golosa
Golosa is a Ruby [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) application, designed for language-learners to use as a vocabulary aid. Generally a dictionary is too inconvenient and cumbersome to use when starting out learning a language. Use Golosa to keep track of the vocabulary words (and their translations) that are important to you.

## Getting Started

#### If Shoes and Rake are installed

2. Via the command line, navigate to the directory that you would like to build Golosa

3. Run these commands in order

        > git clone https://github.com/swcraig/golosa
        > rake install
        > shoes personal.rb

#### If Shoes and Rake are not installed

1. Download the [v1.0.0 release of Golosa](https://github.com/swcraig/golosa/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (only Golosa.exe and config.yml, not the Source code)

2.  Place Golosa.exe in the directory of your choosing.  A folder will be created in this directory when Golosa is run for the first time; you should want all Golosa data to live in this directory from now on!

3. Run Golosa.exe

  Shoes is included in this executable and will start to download.  If the download stops indefinitely, all is well, click "cancel" and run Golosa.exe again. Golosa will start without any issue.

4. Start to use Golosa daily and become a polyglot

<sub>Installation instructions were tested on Windows 7</sub>  

#### V2 Updates
* GUI overhaul!
* No need to provide home directory, everything is setup relative to where .exe is placed
* Alphabetical sorting of languages
* Ability to delete languages from GUI

<sub>Development was done with Shoes 3.2.21</sub>
