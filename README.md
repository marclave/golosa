# Golosa
Golosa is a Ruby [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) application, designed for language-learners to use as a vocabulary aid. Generally a dictionary is too inconvenient and cumbersome to use when starting out learning a language. Use Golosa to keep track of the vocabulary words (and their translations) that are important to you.

## Getting Started

First, [download](http://shoesrb.com/downloads/) Shoes

Second, Run these three commands in order

    > git clone https://github.com/swcraig/golosa
    > rake install
    > shoes personal.rb
