# Golosa
Golosa is an open-source Ruby [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) application, designed for language-learners to use as a vocabulary aid. Generally a dictionary is too inconvenient and cumbersome to use when starting out using a language. Use Golosa to keep track of the vocabulary words (and their translations) that are important to you.
